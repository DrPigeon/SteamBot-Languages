## SteamBot Languages

### Translating:
To create a translation, just download one of the .json files in [/languages](https://github.com/billy-yoyo/SteamBot-Languages/tree/master/languages) and translate it. 

DO NOT TRANSLATE THE KEYS, for example: `"game": "Must wait another %t seconds before searching again (%cd second cooldown)"`

You can translate the `"Must wait another %t seconds before searching again (%cd second cooldown)"` part, but don't translate the command name `game`.

Anything like `%t`, `%cd` or `%s` are where information will be added, don't remove these. Try and keep formatting the same please.

Once you've translated it, just send me a PM with the .json file ([hastebin](https://hastebin.com/) / [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) / [paste.ee](https://paste.ee/) / [gist](https://gist.github.com/) is fine), you'll be given a contributor [Discord](https://discord.gg/JSGpedK) role and if requested tell me your github name and I'll add you as a collaborator too.
